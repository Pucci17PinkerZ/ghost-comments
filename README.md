**Ghost Comments** is an ultra-lightweight VS Code extension designed to reduce visual noise in your code. It allows you to make comments invisible (or transparent) instantly via a keyboard shortcut, letting you focus on the pure logic of the code.

> "Love comments but hate how they pollute your code?" — Ghost Comments is the solution.

## ✨ Features

- 👁️ **Instant Toggle**: Hide/Show comments in a split second.
- 💨 **Zero Latency**: Uses VS Code's native decoration API (no text modification).
- 🧹 **Visual Code Folding**: Reduces comment font size to near-zero to simulate line deletion.
- 🌐 **Multi-Language**: Works with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and many more (`//` and `/* */` detection).

## 🚀 Installation

### ⚡ Quick Install (Command Line)
Simply run this command in your terminal to install the extension directly:
